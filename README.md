# Emoji picker

This was inspired by [H. Ryan Jones'](https://github.com/hryanjones) awesome [emoji picker](https://github.com/hryanjones/emoji-picker) project. So it's really just a copy of that, but I wanted to make it myself. The only thing I took was the [list of emojis](https://github.com/hryanjones/emoji-picker/blob/master/index.html#L79), but apart from that it's just my take on it.
